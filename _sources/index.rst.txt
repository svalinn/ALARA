ALARA: Analytic and Laplacian Adaptive Radioactivity Analysis
=============================================================

The primary purpose of ALARA is to calculate the induced activation
caused by neutron irradiation throughout a nuclear system
(including fission reactors, fusion reactors, and accelerators).
Some projects currently using ALARA include ARIES, IFMIF and the
Z-Pinch Power Plant study.

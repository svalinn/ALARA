Features of ALARA
=================

	ALARA takes full advantage of being a newly developed 
	code by implementing the best features of the previous 
	generation of activation codes and, at the same time, 
	addressing their various weaknesses. Furthermore, an 
	entirely new set of features has been implemented and 
	continued development will allow it to respond to the 
	evolving needs of the entire user community. ALARA's 
	three main design principles are accuracy, speed, and 
	usability. ALARA matches the previous generation of 
	activation codes in accuracy and is much faster. This 
	is achieved by adaptively choosing the mathematical 
	method at the smallest resolution in order to optimize 
	both speed and accuracy. 

	ALARA distinguishes itself by including unique 
	capabilities that are useful to engineers and designers: 

	* unlimited number of reaction channels 
	* exact modeling of hierarchical arbitrary irradiation schedules 
	* reverse calculation mode 

	ALARA implements many of the standard features of 
	activation codes including: 

	* multi-point (3-D) solutions in a variety of geometries 
	* accurate solution of loops in activation trees 
	* exact modeling of multi-level pulsing irradiation 
	  histories 
	* user-defined calculation precision/accuracy 
	* tracking the accumulation of light ions 
	* straightforward, user-friendly input file creation 
	* full, easy-to-read activation tree output (not just 
	  pathway analysis) 
	* flexible output options NOW including the direct 
	  calculation of waste disposal ratings and clearance 
	  indices. 

	Finally, ALARA is undergoing continuous development with 
	many :doc:`new features <whatsnew>` planned for implementation, 
	both to increase the level of physical modeling, the range of 
	problems which can be solved, and its ease of use. ALARA 
	is a fully developed and validated alternative to the 
	previous generation of activation codes.

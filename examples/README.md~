# Workflow Examples

**Purpose:**

_These Tutorials use specific CAD models to explain and demonstrate important steps of the DAGMC workflow. By going through the tutorials one should understand the basic workflow of using DAGMC and the basic functionality of SpaceClaim and Trelis/Cubit in the DAGMC workflow._

## Overview of Tutorials:
  * Tutorials that start with an existing CAD file:
     - [Overview of each tutorial including geometry](CharacteristicsOfCanon.md)
  * Tutorials that start by creating a CAD file using Cubit/Trelis:
     - [Overview of each tutorial including geometry](overviewCADfromCubit.md)

## Tutorials that start with a CAD file created with CAD software

  * Example of 4 Simple Cubes: _**incomplete work in progress**_
     - [Full tutorial](SimpleBlockX4.md)
     - [The model before edits in Cubit/Trelis](Simple100BlockX4.SAT)
     - [The model after the addition of a graveyard and implicit complement](Simple100BlockX4WGraveyardVoid.sat)
     - [Blocks and larger volumes after imprinting and  merging](Simple100BlockX4WGraveyardVoidMerged.sat)

  * Example of Unclean Model with Common Errors:
     - [Full tutorial](ErrorBlocks.md)
     - [Blocks in Solidworks assembly format](ErrorBlocks.SLDASM)
     - [Blocks in ACIS (.sat) format](ErrorBlocks.SAT)
     - [Blocks in SpaceClaim format](ErrorBlocks.scdoc)

  * Example of Complex Model to Show Possible Complications: _**incomplete work in progress**_
     - [Full tutorial](ComplexAssembly.md)

## Tutorials that start by creating a CAD file using Cubit/Trelis

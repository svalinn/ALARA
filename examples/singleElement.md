# singleElement
The singleElement.ala input file illustrates use of ALARA to irradiate a single element (Fe) with a neutron flux/spectrum from the Inboard First Wall (IB-FW) of the FESS-FNSF DCLL (PbLi) fusion reactor for a single 2 year pulse and calculate a variety of activation responses.

The activation responses calculated are:
1. number_density
2. specific_activity
3. decay heat
4. contact dose

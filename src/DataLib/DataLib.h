/** \brief This class is the base class for the handling of all nuclear
           data libraries.  
 
    Various classes are derived from this class which may be instantiated
    directly or serve as base classes for another class.  All data libraries
    have some common members, which are declared as members of this base 
    class, but is serves primarily to define the interface to the data 
    libraries.

    *** Supported Data Library Formats ***

    This catalogue of data library types should be included in every new
    module developed to support a new data library format.
    
    Input
    Identifier     Value   String   Description
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    DATALIB_NULL     0     null     A basic DataLib object
    (should rarely be used in final object)
    DATALIB_ALARA    1     alara    The default ALARA v1 binary mreged format.
    DATALIB_ASCII    2     ascii    A basic ASCII DataLib object
    (should rarely be used in final object)
    DATALIB_EAF      3     eaf      A data library following the formatting
    definition of the EAF library (roughly
    ENDF/B-6) 
    DATALIB_ADJOINT  4     adj      An alara binary library in reversed format
    for reverse calculations.
    DATALIB_GAMMA    5     gamma    An alara binary library containing gamma
    source information.
    DATALIB_IEAF     6     ieaf     A data library with cross-section
    libraries following the GENDF format and 
    decay/gamma libraries following the 
    formatting definition of the EAF library 
    (roughly ENDF/B-6) 
    DATALIB_FEIND    7     feind    A FEIND library
    DATALIB_ALARAJOY 8     ajoy     A hybrid data library following the formatting
                                    definition of the FENDL 3.2b (TENDL 2017)
                                    library (TENDL and PENDF format, converted
                                    to GENDF format by an NJOY wrapped Python 
                                    preprocessor) for transmutation and the EAF
                                    library for decay.

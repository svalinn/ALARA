/** \brief This class is invoked as a linked list and describes a spatial
 *         normalization for each of the geometrical intervals of the 
 *         problem.
 *
 *  Each Norm object should correspond to a Volume object where this
 *  normalization will be applied to the flux.  Such a normalization can
 *  be used, for example, to compensate for geometrical modelling
 *  shortcuts in the transport calculation: e.g. using a cylinder to model
 *  a torus.  The first element of the main problem-wide list has type
 *  NORM_HEAD (defined through the scale member), and contains no problem
 *  data.

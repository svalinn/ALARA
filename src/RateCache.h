/** \brief This class stores implements a fixed size cache for scalar
 *         reaction rates.  (One of these objects is associated with 
 *         each flux in the problem.)
 *  
 *  The fixed size cache (see CACHE_SIZE below) keeps track of all the
 *  reactions for CACHE_SIZE isotopes.  An array of CacheListPtrs is
 *  sorted by the kza number of the base isotope.  Each CacheListPtr 
 *  has a pointer to a CacheData object which contains an array of 
 *  rates, one for each reaction that this base isotope sees.
 *
 *  The CacheData objects are also stored as a doubly-linked list, 
 *  sorted by which object was used most recently.  When the cache is 
 *  full, the least recently used isotope is deleted from the cache in 
 *  order to add the new object.  The CacheData objects store the 
 *  index of the CacheListPtr which points to it, in order to replace 
 *  the value of the CacheListPtr with those the new isotope.  At each 
 *  addition, the array of CacheListPtrs is sorted using a simple bubble 
 *  sort [O(N)].
 *
 *  Some simple analysis has shown that CACHE_SIZE=64 will only have a
 *  cache miss about 1% of the time for a typical problem.  Cache misses
 *  are most likely when changing root isotope, and especially when the
 *  new root isotope has a Z very different from that of the old root
 *  isotope.

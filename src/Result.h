/** \brief This class is used to store the results of each computation.
 *       
 *         A linked list of Result objects will make up two (2) of the 
 *         dimensions for each of the 4-D (interval * input isotope * 
 *         output isotope * cooling time) result arrays.  The head of 
 *         each list is an object of class ResultList, derived from 
 *         this class and indicating the input isotope corresponding to
 *         this list.  Each interval will have a linked list of 
 *         ResultList objects, one for each of the input isotopes which 
 *         exist in that interval.

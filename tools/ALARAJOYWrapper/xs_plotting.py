    """
    Create a plot for a singular nuclide/reaction's cross-sections vs. energy.
        Can be used to plot continuous TENDL data (not processed by ALARAJOY),
        alongside an arbitrary number of groupwise cross-sections according to
        the group structure in which they were converted. Groupwise and
        continuous data can be plotted individually if only one type is
        provided.

    Arguments:
        ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): Matplotlib Axes object of the plot
            being constructed.
        element (str): Symbol of the element to which the nuclide being
            plotted belongs.
        A (str or int): Mass number for selected isonuclide.
            If the target is a metastable isomer, "m" or "n" is written after 
            the mass number, corresponding to the first or second metastable
            states.
        emitted (str): Particle(s) emitted from a nuclear reaction.
        continuous_dict (dict, optional): Dictionary containing an individual
            nuclide's continous TENDL cross-sections and energies for a given
            reaction. Formatted as:
                {'xs' : continuous_xs, 'energies' : continous_energies}

            (Defaults to {})
        groupwise_dict (dict, optional): Nested dictionary keyed at the
            highest level by the name of the group structure according to
            which an array of cross-sections were processed. The form of this
            data structure is as follows:
                {
                    'group_name_1' : {
                        'xs'       : groupwise_xs,
                        'energies' : energy_group_bounds
                    },
                    ...
                    'group_name_n' : {
                        'xs'       : groupwise_xs,
                        'energies' : energy_group_bounds
                    },
                }

            (Defaults to {})

    Returns:
        ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): Updated Matplotlib Axes object of the
            plot being constructed.
